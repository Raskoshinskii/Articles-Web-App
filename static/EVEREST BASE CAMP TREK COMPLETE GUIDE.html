<h2>Food on Everest Base Camp Trek</h2>

<p>On the trek, we spent 27 094 / USD $228 in total on food on an 11-day trek, if you take $25 a day it should be enough for 3 good meals per day, about $8 per meal. Food in the Tea houses was good and not too expensive considering how cheap accommodation is and that the porters and yaks have to carry all the food up the mountain. Overall food prices on EBC are quite similar to those on the other popular trekking routes such as the Annapurna Base Camp trek or the Poon Hill trek.<br> We stayed clear from meat not really trusting the quality of meat up here and it gets very expensive higher up. I treated myself to a Yak steak one night, it was terrible. The table below shows the prices of some popular dishes at tea houses at different elevations, you can see as you go up the mountain prices go up.<br><br> Breakfast we often ate omelettes (2 eggs) and toast and tea with milk, I enjoyed the Masala tea. I am a big caffeine junkie, but only had one or two good coffees, for very expensive, on the trek. Want to drink good espresso while hiking to Everest Base Camp? I carry my Aeropress on most hikes, light, easy and great coffee!<br><br>We also had porridge or pancakes, price was sort of in the same range as toast and eggs.<br><br>Some common Breakfast options trekking to Everest Base Camp: Tibetan bread (bit more filling and oily than chapatti), Chapatti, Toast with jam or honey, French toast, Pancakes, Porridge with milk, Boiled or fried egg.<br><br>We usually had a late lunch when arriving (15:00) and not too long after a fairly early dinner (19:00).<br><br>We were usually starving after a long day of walking so I ordered for volume and taste! We often ordered spaghetti with cheese and tomato, not bad and the portions were big. Dahl is also a good option, the porters live on the stuff, at most places it is ‘bottomless’, when your plate gets empty they will refill your dahl, rice and potatoes, if they don’t offer just ask!<br><br>Food available on most tea house menus; Thukpa (noodle soup), Momos (dumplings), Sherpa stew, a variety of Soups, Macaroni, Spaghetti, Potato, Pizza, Sandwiches, Yak steak, Rice with curry, Burger with chips, Spring Rolls.<br><br><br>For snacks we ate mostly snicker bars, there was cake and pastries available at some of the tea houses, not too get scurvy we bought a couple of apples on the way.</p>
